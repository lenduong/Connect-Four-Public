# Connect-Four
This was a class project that's designed to play Connect-Four, whether it's against an AI or Player vs. Player. 

# Disclaimer
Since this is a class project, some functions were given to me and therefore are not of my own creation. Therefore, I cannot make this project public. However, my AI algorithm is solely my own creation. As such, I will provide public access to that function, but not the rest of the codes that allow the function to run. However, I will create demo videos to show how my AI algorithm works.
